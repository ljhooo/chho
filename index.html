				<h3>Welcome to my homepage!</h3>
				<p class="list-date"></p>
				<p class="list-post">I have been a teacher for over 35 years and have had many wonderful opportunities and experiences.  My first job was as a kindergarten teacher, right after I received my B.S. degree.  It lasted only a few months, but the memories from that time seem to stay forever--I can still recall several of the smiling and curious faces of my youngest students.  </p>
				
				<p class="list-post">I left after three months to fulfill a mandatory twenty-two months of service in the Taiwanese army, but resumed soon after as a teacher again at a senior high school in my home town in northern Taiwan.  During those three years, I worked closely with the students, combining mathematics, college entrance exams, English, and teenagers all together.  It was a lot of fun and I learned a great deal myself, as I was young and eager in my role as a teacher.  A Chinese essay (see my CV) that I wrote and was published in the school bulletin elaborated my teaching philosophy at that time, which has grown and refined along with me up through my role as a university professor in the USA.  Here, Iâ€™ve continued to follow this philosophy while pursuing my passion for teaching and research in statistical theory and methodology.  </p>
