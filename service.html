				<p class="listing">Principal investigator for the Yucca Mountain project, funded by the Agency for Nuclear Projects, State of Nevada, October 1989 - June 2004.  (In the belief that a decision based on up-to-date information and modern analytical techniques are preferable to one based on less sophisticated analysis.  The challenge is to better address the question: Does the possibility of a volcanic eruption pose a great enough risk to the public to disqualify Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste repository?)  I pursue this work with the conviction that I can actually make a contribution in the site characterization study whose solution is vital to the welfare of the State of Nevada and the nation.</p>

				<p class="listing">Reviewed (October 18, 1996) DOE Probabilistic Volcanic Hazard Analysis Report.</p>

				<p class="listing">Testified (August 1, 1995) in the district court as witness (for statistical analysis) on behalf of the State of Nevada in a criminal action prosecuted by the state.</p>

				<p class="listing">Invited to participate in the meeting (held on November 9 - 10, 1993) of the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on the Technical Bases for Yucca Mountain Standards.  I offered scientific opinions on some important elements that might form the technical bases for a site-specific standard to protect public health and safety.</p>

				<p class="listing">Conducted a four-day workshop of Statistical Analysis System (SAS) at the National Chung-Hsing University, Taiwan (April 23, 28, 30, and May 3, 1993).</p>

				<p class="listing">Invited to participate in the 2nd International Meeting and the 4th International Meeting on Volcanology held on January 20 - 24, 1992 and on January 24 - 28, 1994 respectively.  Both meetings were held at Colima, Mexico.  I was motivated by the potential value of my work to people who live under threat from the world's restless volcanoes.  My contribution to the volcanic research program and risk mitigation plans was acknowledged in a certificate of recognition awarded by the Chief Committee Organizer.</p>

				<p class="listing">Invited to present the idea and application of Bayesian concepts to clinical research by Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals Inc. (April 16, 1992).  They were interested in the methodologies that I demonstrated in several of my published papers in the area of clinical trials.</p>

				<p class="listing">Participated in the cancer and biomedical joint research with faculty of the University of Nevada School of Medicine to produce advanced medical procedures (Murry Brown was saved by the revolutionary blood-warming technique developed by my coauthors, L. Gentilello et al., and supported by my statistical analysis).  It demonstrates that my research and publication show a scholarship concerned with human and social betterment.</p>

				<p class="listing">Reviewed Los Alamos National Laboratory Study Plan 8.3.1.8.1.1, Probability of Magmatic Disruption of the Repository.</p>

				<p class="listing">Referee for NSF, Biometrics, Journal of American Statistical Association, International Journal of Earth Sciences, and Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research. </p>
